## General Info
This is basically a very simple dating app. The user will first be promted to answer some questions so they may then find 
the friend with the greatest compatibility. There are some 'friends' already stored so that the user has some variety to work with when matching. The user will complete a 10 question survey
and the answers will be used to determine their best match. Once a match is made a modal will pop up and alert the user of their new friend! 

To-do- list:
* I am not able to get the api working properly
* because i am not able to get it working i cannot deploy it  to heroku i have tried
* need to get the paths working so that I can deploy to heroku and include the heroku link in my portfolio

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
